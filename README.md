# Engineer's Thesis

## The use of IoT devices in smart home applications
The object of the project is smart home. It will be controlled by several STM32 microcontrollers.  

****
### Hardware
Currently I use STM32F303K8 and STM32F411E. Moreover Raspberry Pi 3 B will be master device, which will gather information and visualize them.
Data stored in it will be received from microcontrollers thanks to the nRF905 radio module. 

****
### Graphical user interface
Qt framework is a widget toolkit for creating graphical user interface. Well-equipped set of libraries allows quick and effective GUI development.
